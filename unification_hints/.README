Current task: 
 Implement unification tactics: 
    - tactic takes integer n to specify a subproblem ∧ it takes a problem thm - done
    - extract subproblem n from passed thm - have a question
    - extract the goal from the subproblem extracted - done
    - extract p,q if the goal form is P ≡ Q - have a question
    - call unifier on p,q ⇒ get the seq of (env, thm) - partially done?
    - update the goal (apply the new env to the initially passed problem)
    - remove subproblem n from updated problem ("solve it") with (env,thm)
    - return newly adjusted problem thm'
    - 3 final steps are done for all env from seq of (env,thm) (use functions on seq for iteration)
    
Comments:    
(Seq.map 3 steps seq of (env,thm) → seq thm)
// a→b ... → goal
beware of TrueProp ∧ remove it
